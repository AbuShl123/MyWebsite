            <h3>Write-Up</h3> <br>
            For this project, I decided to address the waste management awereness issue among the students at NU. We already have a lot of opportunities for recycling on the campus, and those are the recycling bins placed around the University. However, most of the waste still goes to the bins of general type. Many students don't care about sorting their waste, and thus, I decided to go with this topic on the video above.
            <br> <br>
            Additionally, we conducted a survey regarding the frequency of plastic bottle usage among the students. Many buy products in plastic bottles almost on everyday basis, which results in a big amount of garbage. Therefore, these observations suggest that implementing the "Bottle Deposit" machines that Germany has, would bring a lot of benefits for the students and also facutly.
            <br> <br>
            During the production of my video, I leveraged a few techniques learned in the "Writer Designer" chapters. First, since the intended primary audience are general people, the usage of specific and professional words have been avoided, for a better understanding of the content.
            While displaying the results of a survey in a chart, I matched the colors of the definitions on the right side with the colors on the chart (Uniform Connectedness, UPD Readigs).
            At the end of the video, I created a small poster to encourage students to sign a petition. In that poster, I darkened the background image to improve legibility (UPD Readigs, p63).
